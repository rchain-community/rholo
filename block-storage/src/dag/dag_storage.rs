/// (`drop_above`) and the removal of the bodies it dropped (`BlockStore`) — and a process that dies
/// between them leaves bodies with no DAG entries. That state is not inert: `block_receiver::not_validated`
/// reads a stored body the DAG does not hold as *"stored but not yet validated"*, re-injects it, and the
/// next child of a dropped block **re-inserts the dropped block above the anchor**, undoing the reset. The
/// window cannot be closed by ordering (the hashes to purge are what the rewind returns) and the reverse
/// order is worse (metadata whose bodies are gone is a wedge), so the node has to be able to *name* the
/// state it is in.
///

/// operation; `Rewound` once both have returned. A boot that finds `Rewinding` knows only that a rewind

/// knows the stores already agree and must **not** rewind again — by then the node may have caught up and
