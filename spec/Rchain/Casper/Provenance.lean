# Law 92 — a replay failure's cause depends on the block's provenance

The 2026-11-08 incident (#564): a proposer built a block, its own replay returned
`ReplayCostMismatch`, and the node classified that as `FailureCause::Divergence` — the cause that
means *this node's view disagrees with the producer's*. There is no producer to disagree with when the
producer is this node. The same replay failure, read as divergence, was not counted, surfaced or
bounded, and the proposer rebuilt the identical block until finality froze.

**The rule, stated before the Rust.** A replay failure has two possible meanings, and the block's
origin picks between them:

* **inbound** — the block came from a peer. Its replay disagreement may be a view difference, so it is
  `Divergence`; the block may be valid elsewhere, and the C173 restoring rule is keyed on exactly
  that cause.
* **self-built** — this node just built the block. Its play and its replay are two executions of
  *this node's own* state, so a disagreement is a local fault. It is never `Divergence`, because
  there is no second view for the node to be diverged from.

**Why this is a law and not a code comment.** The classification is the first hop of the liveness
failure: `handle_errors` collapsed every non-internal `ReplayFailure` into the same hash-mismatch
reading, so the proposer's divergence arm — deliberately not counted (C270) — received a fault that
was not a divergence at all. The model below is deliberately small: it is the decision table, not the
validator. It says which cause a caller may assign, and the Rust's `ValidationOrigin` is that table's
implementation. The bounded-retry policy (holding a deploy set out of selection) is node-local
operating policy, not a consensus rule; it is registered as C357 and is not part of this law.
