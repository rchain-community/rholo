# Law 95 — the replay record is the play's execution order

The 2026-11-08 incident (#564) reached an operator as `ReplayCostMismatch initial_cost=5576
replay_cost=5302`. The mechanism is now established: RSpace **prepends** every event to its log
(`rspace/src/rspace.rs:202-216`, `insert(0, …)`), so the log is newest-first, while
`build_replay_data` (`rspace/src/replay_rspace.rs:129-167`) files each recorded COMM under its
consume/produce refs **in the order it walks that log**. Before the fix the walk was unreversed, so a
later pending request could be offered before the earlier repeated peek's recorded COMM, the peek's
repetition counter (`comm.times_repeated`, compared at `rspace/src/replay_rspace.rs:169-181`) could
not match, work was suppressed, and the replay cost fell by 274. The fix is `log.iter().rev()`.

**The law.** A replay record must file its COMMs in **play (execution) order**. Built chronologically
(`build` below), the candidate list a consume sees is the play's own sequence; built newest-first
(`buildNewestFirst`, the defect's shape), the first matching recorded COMM is a later request's, the
work its continuation performs is different, and the replayed cost differs. The model abstracts
produce/consume identity to `Nat` refs and the continuation to a cost — the law is about the order, not
about hashing — and it carries persistence and the repetition counter because the incident's
suppression is exactly a repeated peek losing its COMM.

**What it does not claim.** It does not model `build_replay_data`'s produce-side map, the matcher, or
the RCHAIN-3505 workaround that drops the reverse half for a failed deploy
(`casper/src/runtime_replay.rs:733-749`); the law fixes the order the data is built in, and a failed
deploy's trace mask remains a separate, recorded hazard (Law 11's note). The incident's 5576/5302 pair
is evidence, not a model witness: the Rust witness
(`casper/tests/replay_trace_order.rs::pending_peeks_replay_with_exact_cost_and_state`) pins the real
costs 1860 / 2606 / 4844, and the Lean witness below is a small decided trace.
