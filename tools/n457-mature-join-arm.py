"""The #457 mature-join arm: a reset validator must LFS-sync a chain that is already 28+ blocks long.

What this asserts, and what it does not. `tools/devnet.sh reset 3` discards validator-3's container and
store and starts it again with `--bootstrap`, so the node must restore the bootstrap's finalized state
from scratch. Before #457 the walk stopped at 3 finished of 28 and failed after three idle rounds; this
arm runs the same shape on a disposable four-validator network and requires the reset node to reach the
bootstrap's height and finalized block, with the sync surface cleared and no `LFS state sync failed` in
its log.

**Fault/acceptance boundary.** A pass is a finite witness on a local Docker bridge: it says the walk now
restores this chain, not that the live testnet join is fixed. The live chain is the observation that
counts, and it is not run here.

Network (a port base and bridge of its own, so it can run beside another devnet):

  DEVNET_PREFIX=n457join DEVNET_NETWORK=n457net \\
  DEVNET_GRPC_BASE=55402 DEVNET_HTTP_BASE=55403 DEVNET_ADMIN_BASE=55405 \\
  tools/devnet.sh up --validators 4 --fresh

**Two recovery shapes, and only one of them is supported.** By default the reset node is started with
`--bootstrap` *and* the devnet's validator key, so it signs from the moment it starts. That is the
shape #576 diagnosed: the node's parent set does not yet contain its own pre-reset blocks, so the
proposer can derive a sequence number the chain already used and sign a genuine second block. With
`--supported-recovery` the node is staged as a passive replicator instead (`DEVNET_RESET_PASSIVE=1`),
allowed to restore and catch up with **no** key, and only then activated with its key from a DAG that
holds its own history (`tools/devnet.sh activate`). The supported shape additionally requires that
the reset node's log contains no `equivocation detected` line. With `--unsupported-shape` the arm
runs the key-present shape and requires the fail-closed guard: if the reset node's own key
equivocates, it must log `this validator's key equivocated` and produce no further block; a run
where the race does not happen and the node converges also passes, because a race that did not
happen cannot falsify the guard.

Usage: tools/n457-mature-join-arm.py [--min-height 28] [--timeout 600] [--out DIR]
                                    [--supported-recovery | --unsupported-shape]
